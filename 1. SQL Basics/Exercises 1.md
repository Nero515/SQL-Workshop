Exercise 1.01: In this exercise, we're going to start building the database for a Packt Online Shopâ€”a store that sells a variety of items to customers. We will be using the MySQL Community Server in this book. The Packt Online Shop has been working on spreadsheets so far, but as they plan to scale up, they realize that this is not a feasible option, and so they wish to move toward data management through SQL. The first step in this process will be to create a database named PACKT_ONLINE_SHOP with a table for storing their customer details.
Exercise 1.02: Now that we have the Customers table ready, let's insert values into the table using a single query. We have the data from an already existing Excel spreadsheet. We will be using that data to write our query.
