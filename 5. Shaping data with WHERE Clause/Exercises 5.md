Exercise 5.01: The store manager wants a list of all the items that are priced over $14.99 and wants to label them as high-value products.
Exercise 5.02: The store manager now wants to list all the items in the range of $14.99 to $50 as mid-priced items.
Exercise 5.03: The store manager realizes that the tomato sauce received has gone bad, so he does not want to present it in the list of available items. 
Exercise 5.04: To increase area-wide sales in LA, we want a list of customers from LA. We don’t currently have any field specifically mentioning the state/country, but since we record the customers’ phone details, we can filter the phone numbers that start with the code for LA (310).
Exercise 5.05: We want to provide usernames to our customers so they can log into our system. We want to create each username from the customer's first name. However, our system does not allow three-letter usernames. The store manager will have to pull up a report on all the customers with three-letter usernames.
Exercise 5.06: Ideally, we want all customers' first names to be in our system. For any customer whose first name is missing from our data, we want to contact the customer and ask them about the missing information.
Exercise 5.07: Joe, a customer from LA, has requested to speak to the store manager regarding a complaint. We are going to write a query to retrieve all of this customer's details. This will allow the manager to have all the required information to best help resolve the customer's complaint.
